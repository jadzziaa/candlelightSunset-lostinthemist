name=Better Sorting - P.S. Consistency Tweaks
id=BSSmorgasbord-ConsistencyTweaks
description=This is an optional add-on to tweak naming convention and correct tooltips for a variety of mods which have Better Sorting categorization but might otherwise clash with one another when it comes to the names for skill books and the like.  I've also included some coverage for where there are missing EN tooltips.  Book naming scheme for this add-on follows more standardized formatting e.g. Advanced Scavenging -> Scavenging Vol.3
