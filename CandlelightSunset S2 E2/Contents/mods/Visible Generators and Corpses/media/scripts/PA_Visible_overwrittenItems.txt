/* NOTE: overwriting vanilla items is generally a BAD PRACTICE. However, for whatever reason, using lua + the DoParam function to modify the script items in question did not work in this instance.
I have no idea why; using lua in that fashion has always worked before in my experience, and is best pratices, but in this case I had to overwrite the scripts themselves.
Hopefully I will be able to figure out the issue and find a solution that works w/o overwriting vanilla items, as it is a BAD PRACTICE. */
