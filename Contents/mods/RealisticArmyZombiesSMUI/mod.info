name=Realistic Army Zombies (SMUI Compatibility)
id=RealisticArmyZombiesSMUI
description=This version is most recommended, and is usable with Shark's Military Uniform Improvements. Zombies from Shark's mod have a moderate chance of spawning in with PPE, and zombies in MOPP 4 will spawn in on military locations. Will only work if SMUI is enabled alongside this mod. For multiplayer, make sure this mod is loaded after SMUI. ONLY ENABLE ONE VERSION OF RAZ!!!
